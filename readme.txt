That's it! 'Hola Simpsons' will appear with quotes in your admin area.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Does this plugin host information in the local WordPress database? =

No. Currently the plugin does not host information in the database. We have plans that do so in future versions.

= Can I add new quotes or remove the ones I don't like? =

No. Currently these actions cannot be performed. We have plans that you can customize quotes in future versions.

= In which languages will the quotes be displayed? =

Only in Spanish (at the moment). We have plans that are also displayed in English (and you can configure this) in future versions.

= Does this plugin connect to any external web service? =

Not right now. We have plans to do it in future versions, to obtain updated quotes without the need for changes in the code.

= I love it, how can I show my appreciation? =

If you have been impressed with this plugin and would like to somehow show some appreciation, rather than send a donation my way, please donate to your charity of choice. I will never ask for any form of reward or compensation. Helping others achieve their goals is satisfying for me :)
